		<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Hello. I am the co-Executive Director of <a href="https://codeforscience.org">Code for Science & Society</a>, where I support the work of <a href="https://datproject.org">the Dat project</a>, <a href="https://stenci.la">Stencila</a>, and <a href="https://sciencefair-app.com">ScienceFair</a>. </p>

			<p>I am committed to working on projects that apply open source philosophy to research and scholarship to improve research transparency, reproducibility, and public access to information. I completed a PhD in Neuroscience at Oregon Health & Science University in 2016. During my PhD training, I received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. I lead student advocacy efforts on my campus, including the passage of OHSU's PhD student parental leave policy, and supported the local open research community through <a href="http://openinsightpdx.com/">Open Insight PDX</a>, <a href"https://biodata-club.github.io/">BioData Club</a>, and <a href="http://portland.sciencehackday.com/">Science Hack Day PDX</a>. In 2016, I joined Mozilla's Science Lab as a <a href="https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows/">Mozilla Fellow for Science</a>, where I ran in Working Open Workshops around the world and explored decentralized data archiving as a DataRescue strategy.

			<p> I'm an open science advocate who believes in the power of inclusive communities. I'm active in communities advancing open research including OpenCon, Mozilla Science and Open Leadership, DataRescue, and Science Hack Day. In my hometown, I'm a founding member of <a href="https://womeninsciencepdx.org/">Women in Science Portland</a>, a nonprofit organization, where I serve as the Communications Chair. </p>

				<p>Find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins">@daniellecrobins</a> - I'm is always interested in talking about improving public access to research and data. </p>

			<h2>Resume and upcoming events</h2>
			<p> During my fellowship with Mozilla Science, I got into the habit of updating a markdown resume with all the speaking, workshops, conferences, and other stuff I am doing. It's way too much information. But it helps me keep track of everything, so I keep it updated. (Thanks Aure!)
