		<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Hello! I'm an open science advocate who believes in the power of inclusive communities. I am committed to working on projects that apply open source philosophy to research and scholarship to improve research transparency, reproducibility, and public access to information. I currently serve as the co-Executive Director of <a href="https://codeforscience.org">Code for Science & Society</a>, where I write grants and make friends for <a href="https://datproject.org">the Dat project</a>, <a href="https://stenci.la">Stencila</a>, and <a href="https://sciencefair-app.com">ScienceFair</a>. </p>

			<p>I completed a PhD in Neuroscience from Oregon Health & Science University and was a <a href="https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows">2016 Mozilla Fellow for Science</a>. During my PhD, I received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and lead advocacy efforts on my home campus and in the open science community.

			<p>I'm active in communities advancing open research including OpenCon, Mozilla Science and Open Leadership, DataRescue, and Science Hack Day. In my hometown, I'm a founding member of <a href="https://womeninsciencepdx.org/">Women in Science Portland</a> where I serve as the Communications Chair. </p>

				<p>Find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins">@daniellecrobins</a> where I'm is always interested in talking about improving public access to research and data. </p>

			<h2>Resume and upcoming events</h2>
			<p> During my fellowship with Mozilla Science, I got into the habbit of updating a markdown resume with all the speaking, workshops, conferences, and other stuff I am doing. It's way too much information. But it helps me keep track of everything, so I keep it updated. (Thanks Aure!)
