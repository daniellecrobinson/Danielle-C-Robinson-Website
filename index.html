		<h2>My work today</h2>
			<p>I am the Co-Executive Director of <a href="https://codeforscience.org">Code for Science & Society</a>, a nonprofit that supports and incubates open source projects in the public interest. CS&S works across domains, drawing a diverse community from research, science, the arts, civic tech, academia, and new media. We work to connect communities across these domains and identify barriers to open source project success that impact everyone. Learn more at  <a href="codeforscociety.org">codeforscience.org</a>.

		<h2>How did I get here?</h2>	
		<p>I completed a PhD in Neuroscience at Oregon Health & Science University in 2016. During my PhD training, I received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and ultimately developed a quantitative imaging appraoch to explore the role of pseudophosphatases in a subtype of Charcot Marie Tooth Disease. I also led student advocacy efforts on my campus, including the passage of OHSU's PhD student parental leave policy, and develpment of local open research community through <a href="http://openinsightpdx.com/">Open Insight PDX</a>, <a href"https://biodata-club.github.io/">BioData Club</a>, and <a href="http://portland.sciencehackday.com/">Science Hack Day PDX</a>. During this time, I became increasingly interested in the influence of funders, publishers, and other forces on how research is conducted and communicated. After my PhD, I spent a transformative year as a Mozilla Fellow, where I ran open source project management workshops around the world, explored decentralized approaches to data preservation, and advocated for open access to research. 

			<h2>Resume and upcoming events</h2>
			<p> During my fellowship with Mozilla Science, I got into the habit of updating a markdown resume with all the speaking, workshops, conferences, and other stuff I am doing. It's way too much information. But it helps me keep track of everything, so I keep it updated. (Thanks Aure!)
