		<h2>Open source in the public interest</h2>
			<p>I am the Co-Executive Director of <a href="https://codeforscience.org">Code for Science & Society</a>, a nonprofit that supports and incubates open source projects in the public interest. CS&S works across domains, drawing a diverse community from research, science, the arts, civic tech, academia, and new media. We work to connect communities across these domains and identify barriers to open source project success that impact everyone.

		<h2>Past experience & education</h2>
		<p>Previously, as a <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/fellowships/">Mozilla Fellow</a>, I ran open source project management workshops around the world, explored decentralized approaches to data preservation, and advocated for open access to research. I completed a PhD in Neuroscience at Oregon Health & Science University in 2016. During my PhD training, I received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and developed a quantitative imaging approach to explore the role of pseudophosphatases in a subtype of Charcot Marie Tooth peripheral neuropathy. During this time, I became increasingly interested how the influence of funders, publishers, and other forces impact how research is conducted and communicated. Engagement with the global <a href="https://www.opencon2018.org/">OpenCon</a> and <a href="https://www.science.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Science</a> communities helped me to build advocacy and community engagement skills. On my campus, I led student advocacy efforts, including the passage of OHSU's <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/academic-programs/graduate-studies/upload/2013-03-15-Academic-adjustment-for-new-parentsFINAL.pdf">PhD student parental leave policy</a>. I also developed programs to grow the local open research community, including <a href="http://openinsightpdx.com/">Open Insight PDX</a>, <a href="https://biodata-club.github.io/">BioData Club</a>, and <a href="http://portland.sciencehackday.com/">Science Hack Day PDX</a>.
